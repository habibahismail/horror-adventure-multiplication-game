# Somekind of Horror Adventure Multiplication Game.

A 'syok sendiri' game in progress for me to learn c# and unity3d.

Most of the assets used in this game are free assets downloaded from various sites especially from Unity Asset Store.


## Includes (so far):

- Start and pause menu.
- Loading screen.
- Saving and loading.
- Item pickup.
- Simple inventory.
- Dialogue system.
- Randomly generated codes and hints for keypad security system for new game.
- Unlocking locked door with the codes.


## To do:

- Fix and refactor the enemy AI.
- Hint system for keypad codes.


### Battle System:

Enemies instead of shooting the player to death will only ask some simple multiplication questions.

The boss will starts chasing player when his anger meter is full.

Some kind of player hide and seek.
